EqzUcMzfV1w,UgwVX-luEa42BTEhGEF4AaABAg,Thanks  Brad    great  in  depth  presentation  on  all  the  latest  trends
EqzUcMzfV1w,Ugzb52dKRwN0VxcxrkF4AaABAg,Kudos  for  making  dark  background    my  eyes  thanking  you    About  to  start  my  developer  journey    this  video  answered  a  lot  of  my  questions  
EqzUcMzfV1w,UgzfXQoJirK9ZZwDZ9l4AaABAg,Worth  mentioning  that  Github  pages  is  also  a  very  convenient  option  for  hosting  static  pages    as  long  as  you  don't  mind  making  the  source  repository  public  
EqzUcMzfV1w,UgxvGs5Zk9kRLhmZQFZ4AaABAg,As  much  as  I  like  your  video's  in  terms  of  quality    comprehensiveness      educational  value  I  would  argue  that  you  are  reaching  a  plateau  in  terms  of  available  technology    If  I  might  suggest  something  is  that  you  start  to  diverge  from  this  path  and  pause  on  doing  yearly  iterations  of  tutorials  on  the  programming  languages      I  am  certain  that  you  as  a  content  creator  can  feel  like  you  keep  doing  the  same  things  over  and  over  again    Not  that  your  content  is  bad        It's  quite  the  contrary    IMO  you're  the  best  tutor  on  the  interwebs  by  far  in  terms  of  enthusiasm    method      all  round  knowledge  while  being  a  down  to  earth  person      What  I  mean  to  say  is  that  programming  languages      its  combo's  into  stacks  can  only  get  you  this  far    A  man  with  your  talent  would  be  imo  the  best  source  for  more  in  depth  programming  paradigms      design  patterns  instead  of  merely  programming  languages    If  you  were  to  teach  the  paradigms      design  patterns  and  architecture  the  viewers  would  be  taught    how      why    to  program  in  a  certain  way    It  could  evolve  into  a  tutorial  series  about  a  microservice  architecture        Especially  since  you  have  the  knowledge  to  do  so        When  you  have  a  microservice  architecture  series  you  could  even  pull  it  a  bit  further      introduce  the  microfrontend  architecture  so  you  can  end  up  having  a  loosely  coupled  architecture    having  microservices    communicating  through  an  event  aggregator      have  the  microfrontends  communicate  between  their  only  contract  being  native  DOM  events    You  are  right  person  to  do  so    since  nobody  is  able  to  teach  this  the  right  way      Mind  you  that  I  started  my  dev  architecture  journey  by  following  your  videos      uploads    I  started  HERE      ended  up  being  a  Senior  Full  Stack  Developer    growing  into  frontend  domain  architecture    position  now      Just  my  2  cents

EqzUcMzfV1w,UgxwSPcq8fVzXvMFrnB4AaABAg,Dunno    I'm  started  to  lean  on  the  idea  that  html      css  and  javascript    the  typical  web  dev  start  of  old  is  no  longer  necessary  if  you're  focus  is  backend      Not  that  it's  useless  or  anything    but  perhaps  starting  with  CLI  applications  and  moving  on  to  HTTP  response      request  is  sufficient  enough
